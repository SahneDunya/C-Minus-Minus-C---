# C-Minus-Minus (C--)
C-- stands for C Minus Minus, which is a version developed by Sahne Dünya that is based on the Classic C language but offers fewer features. It is a very interesting idea to develop this programming language because while many programming languages ​​try to add more features than before, this programming language tried to add less features than before! At first, many people will think that the developer of this language is on the wrong path, but this is actually the opposite. Each programming language has a different purpose and programming languages ​​are shaped according to their purpose. The C-- programming language is actually considered the core of the Classic C language. Because it lacks the Standard Library, Comments feature, and does not support the switch and match features, only supports if-else! The features that are the same as Classic C are basic features, manual memory management, and the need for a header file.
